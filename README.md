Hi!

I am a hobby programmer since the early days of home computing.<br>
I started with the famous C64 in 1983 with Basic, later in 6502-assembler followed by a C128 in 1985.
As a natural progress I got myself a Commodore Amiga 500 in 1987, then an Amiga 4000 in 1993.
On the Amiga I learned C and MC68k-assembler and then finally C++. I wrote several scientific
programs on the Amiga, my most famous one was a virtual planetarium software called "Digital Almanac".

After a long pause in programming I re-started enjoying C++ with MS Visual Studio and got in to
chess programming in 2021.

My current goal is to modify the Stockfish engine and see what I can do to it. Not sure if I am good
enough to contribute to the Stockfish community, but anyone who is interested in my modifications
is welcome to take a look to my changes.

Please take a look in the branch "mymod" of the Stockfish engine and read the changes I made to it
(for my private enjoyment). If you find something useful I have done, let my know it. I am happy
to help.
